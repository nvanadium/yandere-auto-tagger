Description:
    Uses the yande.re API, pixiv, danbooru API and iqdb similarity search to
    update the source and artist data of posts on https://yande.re
    Roughly, code does this for all posts satistying initial query:
    - Check for source, artist and circle tags
    - If source is present, but no artist or circle
        - Use "Find artist" on yande.re and danbooru to get artist tag
    - If no source, use iqdb to find similar posts on danbooru
        - If match is good (>90%), check danbooru for source link
        - If source found on danbooru, but no artist or circle on yande.re
            - Use "Find artist" on yande.re and danbooru to get artist tag
    Script checks that artist tags from danbooru exist on yande.re before adding
    Script will also replace pixiv sources that contain 'member_illust' with the
    direct link to the full-sized image
Requires:
    A config file named 'config.cfg' in the same directory as this script.
    Edit the provided config.cfg with your username and password info for your
    accounts on yande.re, pixiv and danbooru.
    Logging in is required for making changes on yande.re, for seeing R-18 posts
    on pixiv, and for some xml queries on danbooru.
    It is recommended that you create secondary accounts on the 3 sites solely
    for this script's use, so that your primary account passwords are not
    stored on disk.
Usage:
	$./auto_tagger_5.py <limit> <apply>
Where:
	<limit> = number of posts to auto-tag
	<apply> = True - apply tag and source changes
                  False - do not apply tag and source changes (e.g. for testing)
Example:
    $./auto_tagger_5.py 10 True
